# Thumbnail Grid Alternative
## Born to Switch, Forced to Click
Fork of [Zren](https://github.com/Zren)'s [Thumbnail Grid](https://invent.kde.org/plasma/kdeplasma-addons/-/tree/master/windowswitchers/thumbnail_grid) window switcher for [KDE Plasma](https://kde.org/plasma-desktop/) that implements window selection by hovering over the items, instead of clicking them.

## But.. why?
It just fits my workflow better and I found no Plasma 5-compatible alternatives at the time.
